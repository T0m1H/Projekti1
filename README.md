Technologies
I used in this project HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML and CSS was familiar to me before from developing websites course. In this course we are studying Javascript, so it is new thing to me to learn.

Credits
I used W3school and this courses materials in this project. I also used Copilot when I couldn't get my JavaScript to work in some sections despite numerous attempts.
